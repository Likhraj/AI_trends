It seems like you're asking for a boilerplate HTML code. Here's a basic template to get you started:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Title Here</title>
    <!-- You can include CSS files, JavaScript files, and other meta tags here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML boilerplate.</p>

    <!-- You can include JavaScript at the end of the body for better performance -->
    <!-- <script src="your-script.js"></script> -->
</body>
</html
